Task: Create a To-Do List Application

Requirements:

Create a React.js application with a component-based structure.
The application should have a form to add new tasks.
Display a list of tasks with the option to mark them as completed or delete them.
Implement basic styling to make the application visually appealing.
Use state to manage the list of tasks and their completion status.
Bonus: Add local storage functionality to persist tasks even after a page refresh.
Tips:

Use functional components and hooks (e.g., useState) for state management.
Break down the application into smaller components (e.g., TaskList, TaskItem, AddTaskForm).
Focus on creating a clean and readable code structure.
Don't forget to handle user interactions, such as form submission and task completion.
